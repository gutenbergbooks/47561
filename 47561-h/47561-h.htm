      THE FIRST ACT at Mr. and Mrs. Telfer's Lodgings in No. 2 Brydon Crescent,
      Clerkenwell. May
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND ACT at Sir William Gower's, in Cavendish Square. June.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE THIRD ACT again in Brydon Crescent. December.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FOURTH ACT on the stage of the Pantheon Theatre. A few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      PERIOD somewhere in the early Sixties. (1860s)
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE:&mdash;Bagnlgge (locally pronounced Bagnidge) Wells, formerly a
      popular mineral spring in Islington, London, situated not far from the
      better remembered Sadler's-Wells. The gardens of Bagnlgge-Wells were at
      one time much resorted to; but, as a matter of fact, Bagnigge-Wells,
      unlike Sadler's-Wells, has never possessed a playhouse. Sadler's-Wells
      Theatre, however, always familiarly known as the "Wells," still exists. It
      was rebuilt in 1876-77.
    </p>
    <p>
      The costumes and scenic decoration of this little play-should follow, to
      the closest detail, the mode of the early Sixties, the period, in dress,
      of crinoline and the peg-top trouser; in furniture, of horsehair and
      mahogany, and the abominable "walnut -and -rep." No attempt should be made
      to modify such fashions in illustration, to render them less strange, even
      less grotesque, to the modern eye. On the contrary, there should be an
      endeavor to reproduce, perhaps to accentuate, any feature which may now
      seem particularly quaint and bizarre. Thus, lovely youth should be shown
      decked uncompromisingly as it was at the time indicated, at the risk
      (which the author believes to be a slight one) of pointing the chastening
      moral that, while beauty fades assuredly in its own time, it may appear to
      succeeding generations not to have been beauty at all.

    <h2>
      THE FIRST ACT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The scene represents a sitting room on the first floor of a respectable
      lodging house. On the right are two sash-windows, having Venetian blinds
      and giving a view of houses on the other side of the street. The grate of
      the fireplace is hidden by an ornament composed of shavings and paper
      roses. Over the fireplace is a mirror: on each side there is a sideboard
      cupboard. On the left is a door, and a landing is seen outside. Between
      the windows stand a cottage piano and a piano stool. Above the sofa, on
      the left, stands a large black trunk, the lid bulging with its contents
      and displaying some soiled theatrical finery. On the front of the trunk,
      in faded lettering, appear the words "Miss Violet Sylvester, Theatre
      Royal, Drury Lane." Under the sofa there are two or three pairs of ladies'
      satin shoes, much the worse for wear, and on the sofa a white-satin
      bodice, yellow with age, a heap of dog-eared playbooks, and some other
      litter of a like character. On the top of the piano there is a wig-block,
      with a man's wig upon it, and in the corners of the room there stand some
      walking sticks and a few theatrical swords. In the center of the stage is
      a large circular table. There is a clean cover upon it, and on the top of
      the sideboard cupboards are knives and forks, plate, glass, cruet-stands,
      and some gaudy flowers in vases&mdash;all suggesting preparations for
      festivity. The woodwork of the room is grained, the ceiling plainly
      whitewashed, and the wall paper is of a neutral tint and much faded. The
      pictures are engravings in maple frames, and a portrait or two, in oil,
      framed in gilt. The furniture, curtains, and carpet are worn, but
      everything is clean and well-kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light is that of afternoon in early summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mossop&mdash;a portly, middle-aged Jewish lady, elaborately attired&mdash;is
      laying the tablecloth. Ablett enters hastily, divesting himself of his
      coat as he does so. He is dressed in rusty black for "waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [<i>In a fluster.</i>] Oh, here you are, Mr. Ablett&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Good-day, Mrs. Mossop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [<i>Bringing the cruet-stands.</i>] I declare I thought you'd forgotten
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [<i>Hanging his coat upon a curtain-knob, and turning up his shirt
      sleeves.</i>] I'd begun to fear I should never escape from the shop,
      ma'am. Jest as I was preparin' to clean myself, the 'ole universe seemed
      to cry aloud for pertaters. [<i>Relieving Mrs. Mossop of the cruet-stands,
      and satisfying himself as to the contents of the various bottles.</i>] Now
      you take a seat, Mrs. Mossop. You 'ave but to say "Mr. Ablett, lay for so
      many," and the exact number shall be laid for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [<i>Sinking into the armchair.</i>] I hope the affliction of short breath
      may be spared you, Ablett. Ten is the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [<i>Whipping up the mustard energetically.</i>] Short-breathed you may be,
      ma'am, but not short-sighted. That gal of yours is no ordinary gal, but to
      'ave set 'er to wait on ten persons would 'ave been to 'ave caught
      disaster. [<i>Bringing knives and forks, glass, etc., and glancing round
      the room as he does so.</i>] I am in Mr. and Mrs. Telfer's setting-room, I
      believe, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [<i>Surveying the apartment complacently.</i>] And what a handsomely
      proportioned room it is, to be sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      May I h'ask if I am to 'ave the honor of includin' my triflin' fee for
      this job in their weekly book?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      No, Ablett&mdash;a separate bill, please. The Telfers kindly give the use
      of their apartment, to save the cost of holding the ceremony at the
      "Clown" Tavern; but share and share alike over the expenses is to be the
      order of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I thank you, ma'am. [<i>Rubbing up the knives with a napkin.</i>] You let
      fall the word "ceremony," ma'am&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Ah, Ablett, and a sad one&mdash;a farewell cold collation to Miss
      Trelawny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Lor' bless me! I 'eard a rumor&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      A true rumor. She's taking her leave of us, the dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ablett.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be a blow to the "Wells," ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      The best juvenile lady the "Wells" has known since Mr. Phillips's
      management.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Report 'as it, a love affair, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      A love affair, indeed. And a poem into the bargain, Ablett, if poet was at
      hand to write it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Reelly, Mrs. Mossop! [<i>Polishing a tumbler.</i>] Is the beer to be
      bottled or draught, ma'am, on this occasion?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Draught for Miss Trelawny, invariably.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Then draught it must be all round, out of compliment. Jest fancy!
      nevermore to 'ear customers speak of Trelawny of the "Wells," except as a
      pleasin' memory! A non-professional gentleman they give out, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      You don't say, ma'am!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      No father nor mother, and lives in Cavendish Square with the old judge and
      a great aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Then Miss Trelawny quits the Profession, ma'am, for good and all, I
      presoom?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes, Ablett, she's at the theaytre at this moment, distributing some of
      her little ornaments and fallals among the ballet. She played last night
      for the last time&mdash;the last time on any stage. [<i>Rising and going
      to the sideboard-cupboard.</i>] And without so much as a line in the bill
      to announce it. What a benefit she might have taken!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I know one who was good for two box tickets, Mrs. Mossop.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [<i>Bringing the flowers to the table and arranging them, while Ablett
      sets out the knives and forks.</i>] But no. "No fuss," said the Gower
      family, "no publicity. Withdraw quietly&mdash;" that was the Gower
      family's injunctions&mdash;"withdraw quietly, and have done with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      And when is the weddin' to be, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      It's not yet decided, Mr. Ablett. In point of fact, before the Gower
      family positively say Yes to the union, Miss Trelawny is to make her home
      in Cavendish Square for a short term&mdash;"short term" is the Gower
      family's own expression&mdash;in order to habituate herself to the West
      End. They're sending their carriage for her at two o'clock this afternoon,
      Mr. Ablett&mdash;their carriage and pair of bay horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ablett.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Well, I dessay a West End life has sooperior advantages over the
      Profession in some respecks, Mrs. Mossop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      Mrs. Mossop.
    </h4>
    <p>
      When accompanied by wealth, Mr. Ablett. Here's Miss Trelawny but nineteen,
      and in a month-or-two's time she'll be ordering about her own powdered
      footman, and playing on her grand piano. How many actresses do that, I
      should like to know!

      It was singing that song that sealed my destiny, Arthur declares. At any

      as you are aware, of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Miss Sylvester has so
      frequently and, if I may say so, so nobly impersonated the various queens

      our expression of loyalty. [<i>Raising his glass.</i>] The Queen I And

      Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to lose, to part with, one of our
      companions, a young comrade who came amongst us many months ago, who in
      fact joined the company of the "Wells" last February twelvemonth, after a
      considerable experience in the provinces of this great country.

      THE SECOND ACT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The scene represents a spacious drawing-room in a house in Cavendish
      Square. The walls are somber in tone, the ceiling dingy, the hangings,
      though rich, are faded, and altogether the appearance of the room is
      solemn, formal, and depressing. On the right are folding-doors admitting
      to a further drawing-room. Beyond these is a single door. The wall on the
      left is mainly occupied by three sash-windows. The wall facing the
      spectators is divided by two pilasters into three panels. On the center
      panel is a large mirror, reflecting the fireplace; on the right hangs a
      large oil painting&mdash;a portrait of Sir William Gower in his judicial
      wig and robes. On the left hangs a companion picture&mdash;a portrait of
      Miss Gower. In the corners of the room there are marble columns supporting
      classical busts, and between the doors stands another marble column, upon
      which is an oil lamp. Against the lower window there are two chairs and a
      card-table. Behind a further table supporting a lamp stands a threefold
      screen. The lamps are lighted, but the curtains are not drawn, and outside
      the windows it is twilight.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Sir William Gower is seated, near a table, asleep, with a newspaper
      over his head, concealing his face. Miss Trafalgar Gower is sitting at the
      further end of a couch, also asleep, and with a newspaper over her head.
      At the lower end of this couch sits Mrs. de Foenix&mdash;Clara&mdash;a
      young lady of nineteen, with a "married" air. She is engaged upon some
      crochet work. On the other side of the room, near a table, Rose is seated,
      wearing the look of a boredom which has reached the stony stage. On
      another couch Arthur sits, gazing at his boots, his hands in his pockets.
      On the right of this couch stands Captain de Foenix, leaning against the
      wall, his mouth open, his head thrown back, and his eyes closed. De Foenix
      is a young man of seven-and-twenty&mdash;an example of the
      heavily-whiskered "swell" of the period. Everybody is in dinner-dress.
      After a moment or two Arthur rises and tiptoes down to Rose. Clara raises
      a warning finger and says "Hush!" He nods to her, in assent.</i>]

      Yes, I can answer your question. [<i>Painting his stick, first at Rose,
      then at the group.</i>] Some friends of that young woman's connected with&mdash;the
      playhouse, have favored us with a visit, for the purpose of ascertaining
      how she is&mdash;getting on. [<i>Touching Gadd's pipe, which is lying at

      THE THIRD ACT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The scene represents an apartment on the second floor of Mrs. Mossop's
      house. The room is of a humbler character than that shown in the first
      act; but, though shabby, it is neat. On the right is a door, outside which
      is supposed to be the landing. In the wall at the back is another door,
      presumably admitting to a further chamber. Down L. there is a fireplace,
      with a fire burning, and over the mantelpiece a mirror. In the left-hand
      corner of the room is a small bedstead with a tidily-made bed, which can
      be hidden by a pair of curtains of some common and faded material, hanging
      from a cord slung from wall to wall. At the foot of the bedstead stands a
      large theatrical dress-basket. On the wall, by the head of the bed, are
      some pegs upon which hang a skirt or two and other articles of attire. On
      the right, against the back wall, there is a chest of drawers, the top of
      which is used as a washstand. In front of this is a small screen, and
      close by there are some more pegs with things hanging upon them. On the
      right wall, above the sofa, is a hanging bookcase with a few books. A
      small circular table, with a somewhat shabby cover upon it, stands on the
      left. The walls are papered, the doors painted stone-color. An old felt
      carpet is on the floor. The light is that of morning. A fire is burning in
      the grate.</i>

      [<i>Mrs. Mossop, now dressed in a workaday gown, has just finished making
      the bed. There is a knock at the center door.</i>]

      [<i>Mrs. Mossop draws the curtains, hiding the bed from view. Avonia
      enters by the door on the right in a morning wrapper which has seen its
      best days. She carries a pair of curling-tongs, and her hair is evidently
      in process of being dressed in ringlets.</i>]

    <p>
      It's the pantomime. I'm always stark mad as the pantomime approaches. I
      don't grudge letting the rest of the company have their fling at other
      times&mdash;but with the panto comes <i>my</i> turn. [<i>Throwing herself
      full length upon the sofa gleefully.</i>]Ha, ha, ha! the turn of Avonia
      Bunn! [__With a change of tone.__] I hope Miss Trelawny won't take a walk
      up to Highbury, or anywhere, after rehearsal. I want to borrow her gilt
      belt. My dress has arrived.

    <p>
      Yes, Mrs. Burroughs is coming down from the theatre at twelve-thirty to
      see me in it. [<i>Singing. "Any kind of villainy cometh natural to me. So

      gets the sack&mdash;the entire sack, Sir Gower! So there's nothing left
      for her but to starve, or to make artificial flowers. Miss Trelawny I'm

      THE FOURTH ACT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The scene represents the stage of a theatre with the proscenium arch,
      and the dark and empty auditorium in the distance. The curtain is raised.
      The stage extends a few feet beyond the line of the proscenium, and is
      terminated by a row of old-fashioned footlights with metal reflectors. On
      the left, from the proscenium arch runs a wall, in which is an open
      doorway supposed to admit to the Green-room. Right and left of the stage
      are the "P." and "O. P." and the first and second entrances, with wings
      running in grooves, according to the old fashion. Against the wall are
      some "flats." Just below the footlights is a T-light, burning gas, and
      below this the prompt-table. On the right of the prompt-table is a chair,
      and on the left another. Against the edge of the proscenium arch is
      another chair; and nearer, on the right, stands a large throne-chair, with
      a gilt frame and red velvet seat, now much dilapidated. In the "second
      entrance" there are a "property" stool, a table, and a chair, all of a
      similar style to the throne-chair and in like condition, and on the
      center, as if placed therefor the purpose of rehearsal, are a small
      circular table and a chair. On this table is a work-basket containing a
      ball of wool and a pair of knitting-needles; and on the prompt-table there
      is a book. A faded and ragged green baize covers the floor of the stage.
      The wings, and the flats and borders, suggest by their appearance a
      theatre fallen somewhat into decay. The light is a dismal one, but it is
      relieved by a shaft of' sunlight entering through a window in the flies on
      the right.</i>
